# Basics

## Constants

Constants are named values that can never be reassigned.
To declare a constant we write `name value`. For example:

```flame
pi 3.1415
```

We can now use `pi` wherever we would like to use `3.1415`.

## Variables

A variable is a named value that can be reassigned.
To declare a variable we write `name: value`. For example:

```flame
quote: "Not all those who wander are lost."
```

Above, `quote` took the type of the value we assigned to it, which in this case is [`String`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)).

:::important
Once a variable is declared its type can never be changed.
:::

We can assign a new value to `quote`, as long as it is also of type `String`:

```flame
quote = "There is nothing permanent except change."
```

## Lists

A list is an ordered collection of values.
To create a list we use square brackets:

```flame
emptyList []
somePrimes [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
multi [1, "hi", SYMBOL]
```

List elements can be accessed via indexing:

```flame
somePrimes[0] # The first element of `somePrimes`
multi[2] = "cat" # Update the third element of `multi`
```

To append an element to the end of a list use `push`:

```flame
multi.push(ðŸ”¥)
```

## Objects

An object is an unordered collection of named values.
To create an object we specify its properties' names and values inside parentheses:

```flame
person (name: "Daniel, age: 29)
```

Object properties can be accessed and updated:

```flame
person.name # "Daniel"
person.age = 30 # Update person.age
```

## Functions

A function is a reusable block of code.
To create a function we write `( ... ) -> { ... }`.
The parentheses are always necessary.
If the function body is only a single expression then the braces can be omitted:

```flame
add (a, b) -> { a + b }
sub (a, b) -> a - b
```
